PROJECT BACKGROUND : 
This project is about how to build a web app using Angular-Firebase. AngularFire is the officially supported AngularJS binding for Firebase. Firebase is a backend service that provides data storage, file storage, authentication, and static website hosting for your Angular app. AngularFire is a complement to the core Firebase client.

DISCUSSION : 

This project was centered on developing a web application using Angular and Firebase, tools that ease web development. Some of the common issues that developers encounter include creating a backend system, databases, and hosting of the application. Angular and Firebase are compatible to address these problems, which makes the development more efficient.

Angular is perfect for building web applications with components and easy to navigate between them. Firebase does this by offering pre-built backend functionalities such as real-time database, user authentication, hosting, and storage. Combined, they enable developers to work on features rather than on servers and server configurations.

The purpose of this project was to understand how to develop a web app with Angular and Firebase. It also wanted to address practical issues, including how to address real-time data changes, implement a login system, and support many users.

This project helped me to understand that it is crucial to think through the system configuration and approach to technical problems. It also demonstrated to me that creating a good web app is not a one day affair but rather requires time, patience and hard work. In general, this project was a good opportunity to get acquainted with the modern approach to web development and such tools as Angular and Firebase that help to build applications of high quality.
